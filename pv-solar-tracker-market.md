<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Solar Tracker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-axis</li><li>Dual axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PV solar tracker market primarily consists of two types: single-axis and dual-axis trackers. Single-axis trackers rotate on one axis, typically following the sun's east-to-west movement throughout the day, thus optimizing energy capture. Dual-axis trackers can move on both horizontal and vertical axes, allowing them to follow the sun's path more precisely throughout the year, accommodating seasonal changes. While single-axis trackers are more cost-effective, dual-axis trackers offer higher energy gains, making them suitable for specific applications and regions.</p></p>
